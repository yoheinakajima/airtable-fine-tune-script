Script for fine-tuning GPT-3 from Airtable.

# CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE
I think I have the data format pretty close, but got stuck at creating the file from the OpenAI with the https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/ end point from Javascript.</br>
(1) Unsure if data is cleaned up propertly, couldn't figure out how to check file format.</br>
(2) Unsure if API call to the files endpoint is structured correctly.</br></br>

# NEXT STEPS
(1) First fix the above</br>
(2) Once file is created, send to fine-tunes endpoint to create the new model.</br>
(3) Store data from the new model (eg. name) in Airtable.
